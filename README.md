# Flappy Bird-Inspired Game on STM32 (Mikroe Fusion)
This project is a Flappy Bird-inspired game developed on an embedded system, running on the Mikroe Fusion board with an STM32 ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller.

## üéÆ Features
- Gameplay: The "bird" is represented by an LED on a 7x10 matrix and controlled in two modes:               
  - Rotary button for manual jumps         
  - MPU 9DOF accelerometer for tilt-based movement
- Dynamic Obstacles: Randomly generated walls move from right to left.
- Score Display: The current score is shown on a 2x7-segment LED display.
- Game Over Mechanism: A collision triggers a "game over" melody played through the buzzer.
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Microcontroller: STM32 ARM Cortex-M4
- Display: 7x10 LED matrix
- Input Controls: Rotary encoder & MPU 9DOF accelerometer
- Audio Output: Buzzer-generated sound effects
  
  This project demonstrates real-time embedded programming, sensor integration, and interactive gameplay mechanics on a constrained hardware platform.
